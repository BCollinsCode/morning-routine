# morning-routine
Interface to guide me through my morning routine with timestamps and other saved data and visualization
Some rough ideas:
-Java Spring Boot app
-SQL for data
-one task at a time fullscreen
-tasks like journaling and gratitude journal have a large text editor
-every task has a timer
-anything that can be improved should have fields for entering metrics (like sets/reps for excercises)
-should sync to a mobile app so that I can bring my phone around with me to the shower etc
-easily enter new, edit, and rearange tasks
-ideally should have audio ques and respond to voice feedback "stop alarm" "finish task" "3 sets 10 reps, next excercise", etc...might bag this down the road
